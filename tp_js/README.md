# JavaScript Exercises

## Exercise 1: Temperature Conversion

**Description:**
This exercise implements a function called `degreC()` that converts a given temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius using the formula:

\[ \text{tempC} = \frac{5}{9} (\text{tempF} - 32) \]

The function prompts the user to enter a temperature in Fahrenheit and then displays the equivalent temperature in Celsius.

## Exercise 2: Time Conversion

**Description:**
This exercise defines a function called `hjms()` that converts a given number of seconds into days, hours, minutes, and seconds. The function prompts the user for input and displays the result.

**Conversion Rules:**
- 1 day = 24 hours
- 1 hour = 60 minutes
- 1 minute = 60 seconds

**Technologies Used:**
- JavaScript (prompt and alert functions)

**Example:**
```
Enter number of seconds: 90061
Result: 1 day, 1 hour, 1 minute, 1 second
```

## Exercise 3: Improved Time Conversion

**Description:**
This exercise enhances the `hjms()` function by improving the output format:
- Values that are zero are omitted from the display.
- Singular/plural handling (e.g., "1 hour" instead of "1 hours").

**Example:**
```
Enter number of seconds: 7320
Result: 2 hours, 2 minutes
```

## How to Run
1. Open a web browser.
2. Open the browser console (F12 > Console).
3. Copy and paste the JavaScript code.
4. Execute the function by calling it, e.g., `degreC();` or `hjms();`.
